## The Beginning

The very first time I used Meteor, I had no idea what I was doing. Watching the tutorial videos and building the digits app, I was following step by step instructions. Mindlessly typing, copying and pasting, and deleting and creating new directories. As if this framework was like a meteoroid, I did not see the greatness of it. It's there, but I just could not see it. To be honest, I thought this framework wasted a lot of time because of the slowness when you first start it. Taking minutes to just create a small and simple hello world program. It seemed to be nothing but a debris in the web development community.

## Hitting the Surface

As I started to get more involved into meteor, and not mindlessly following the instructions provided by my professor, I started to notice the benefits of meteor. One huge upside of meteor is that it updates in real time. I could literally just have made some changes, click ctrl-s and bam, the webpage would have mirrored the changes. Pretty awesome considering I am a very impatient person. Another advantage of meteor? It is highly simplified with frontend, backend, and database all rolled into one language - Javascript. Don't you think it's amazing how just by knowing a single development lanuage, you can develop a full web app with the help of meteor? Now, I am not saying meteor was the easiest thing to learn. Heck, I had a lot of difficulties starting off with it because I had no clue on how it worked. There were many times where my digits app crashed and I had no idea why. I know a lot of my classmates had a much more difficult time with meteor than I have. I cannot imagine having to deal with all the problems they have gone through running meteor on Windows. After getting the jist of how things work, I realized this framework offers such a simple way of coding. With the collection of libraries, packages, and concepts from other frameworks bound together, meteor has been built in a way that makes it easy to prototype applications. It has a lot of "magic" so you won't spend too much time over configuration. It requires less code, which means less bugs. (Can I get a YAY?!) Just like a true meteor, the greatness of this framework has finally become visible. It produced a streak of light with a beautiful glow.
