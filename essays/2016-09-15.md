Configuration management is very important because it allows users to work in groups and be able to view each changes without having each other email their codes. All the changes will be saved in a repository. Also, configuration management keeps track of all the changes that have been made and keeps track of the history. This is very useful because this helps developers be able to find bugs by allowing them to see between which changes did the tests fail.
