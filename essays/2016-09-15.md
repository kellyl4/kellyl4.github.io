Configuration management is very important because it allows users to work in groups efficiently and be able to view each other's changes. Without configuration management, users would have to email each other their code every time they have made a few changes to it, and this becomes very tedious and inefficient especially with huge projects. This can also result in many small errors that may be hard to find. All the changes will be saved in a repository. Also, configuration management stores all the previous versions of a code in the history which will greatly help with debugging. If there is a bug, a user will be able to look back at the history, find out between which changes did the codes start to fail, and go back to fix it. 

During my introduction to computer science class, we had to work in a group to create a game in java. It was difficult working with others because we had a lack of configuration management. When we worked on our codes at home, we would email each other the java classes we had modified. This became very messy and time consuming. When viewing the code I received, I would have to spend time looking for what changes they had made and upload the revised version onto eclipse. Because it wasn't a huge project, it was doable with the way we were working, but this method would definitely have huge negative consequences when dealing with a bigger group of programmers with a much bigger project.

## Git vs GitHub

The reason Git and GitHub are so popular is because they work very well with each other. It is hard to say which made which popular because they both contributed to each other's popularity. GitHub got popular because people realize it is a great web-page to publish their Git repositories and collaborate with other people. Now, GitHub is more popular than Git, but after people get used to GitHub, many start using Git because it is a great version control system and for the convenience of running at the command line of their local computer. Git and GitHub are extremely efficient when used together.
